"Pretty hard game to start I have no clue and the movement feels wack"  
"I didn't get to an upgrade and got beaten by a fat shit"
![Early boss death](images/BindingOfIsaac/1.png)

"This game is cruel but now I found power ups and learned about shooting distances and beat the boss, I believe shooting distances is what killed me last time!"  
"I instantly understood the key"

"Getting easier but damn my character is getting more & more fuckedup"
![Character visually altered by items](images/BindingOfIsaac/2.JPEG)

"Brooooo wtf"
![Unexpected chaotic moment](images/BindingOfIsaac/3.JPEG)

"I like how it all has different enemies based on the maps but I didn't find the true beauty of this game yet I think."  
"I'm soo curious about its story tho"

"Second day I'm getting better actually, still intregued by the story, of the 3 roguelites I played by now this is the one I talk about its story"  
"Combat still feels soo wonky"

## Hades

"I have high hopes of one of the biggest roguelikes out there"

"Omg the dash to cancel attacks is amazing"

"Now this is a combat loop I can get behind, I wanted to try one more game its 2:37pm and I'm fired up!"

"The skill feels amazing, the talking feels amazing I love this game!"  
"It feels soooo free and overpowered!!!"  
"But the rooms do not look procedural in form?"
![Early handcrafted room](images/Hades/1.jpg)

"Char reacts to killing characters that killed him before that's cool!"

"The world feels soo alive making it feel like I'm not replaying the same thing all the time"  
"Story and curiousity makes me constantly go back!"  
"EXPLORATION"

"Hinting to go to bed, really pushing a story is soo cooool!!!"

"I just got health so something is coming"
![Suspicious healing room](images/Hades/18.jpg)

"Well that was to be expected"

## Risk of rain 2

"My hope for a real 3D roguelike shooter"

"First impression"  
"This game is made by programmers!"  
"Fighting feels nice but I can't see any game design so far"
![First open combat area](images/RiskOfRain/1.jpg)

"Omg turret!!!!"
![Turret item pickup](images/RiskOfRain/2.jpg)

"30 min in no story or anything other than just shooting, there is just nothing else"
![Long mid-run with no narrative](images/RiskOfRain/3.jpg)

"I'm just spending all my time finding shrines and shooting shit"  
"I'm not replaying this game damn, I genuinely hated it"  
"Now I know what it's like when a game doesn't have game designers"  
"After an hour of playing I'm just done, the fighting felt nice but it was just too much and mind numbing the entire time there was no goal or logic or anything"
![Shrine-heavy exploration](images/RiskOfRain/4.jpg)
![Endless combat](images/RiskOfRain/5.jpg)
![Teleporter charging](images/RiskOfRain/6.jpg)
![Visual chaos](images/RiskOfRain/7.jpg)
![Late-run boredom](images/RiskOfRain/8.jpg)

"Maybe its unfair to compare its quality to the likes of hades etc but with all the noise around it I suspected way more than just procedural worlds and shooting enemies for hours with no real goal"

"U know what? I'm gonna try to clear it after all, a video was like "yeah this game is really cool so Imma give it another go"  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzEvIDwE7ew

"I'll also have a glass of whiskey to go with it to survive life, right now I could use some mind numbing shooting in combination with alcohol"

"Alright so every level is a new procedurally generated area!"  
"Wait a second only the location of the teleporter is procedural????"

"Still really don't like the game, finding those teleport areas is soo boring"
![Another procedurally similar area](images/RiskOfRain/9.png)

# My rOGUELIKE

- I want it to be 3D third person  
- procedural dungeons in a 3d generated environment?  
- rooms gotta be big  
- Auto lock on to help power fantasy  
- Deck building with weapons abilities and ally deployables?
